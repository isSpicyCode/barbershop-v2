# BarberShop-v2

Welcome to **BarberShop-v2**, a one-page website for a men's barbershop, designed with horizontal scrolling and dynamic interactions using JavaScript. This project was created as part of my web development in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

⚠️ **Project Under Development**: This project is not yet complete. Some features (such as the contact form or full mobile optimization) are still in progress.

## Project Overview

This website serves as a showcase for a fictional **Barber Shop** located in Paris. It offers a smooth user experience with horizontal scrolling to navigate between sections (Home, Services, Booking, Contact, About). The design is modern, responsive, and optimized for GitHub Pages.

### Website URL
The site is hosted on GitHub Pages: [https://isspicycode.github.io/barbershop-v2/](https://isspicycode.github.io/barbershop-v2/)
